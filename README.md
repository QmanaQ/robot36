### Robot36: The Java Cut

This is not a drill!

Get ready to beam in a whole new Robot36, rebuilt from the ground up in pure Java!  Just like that nostalgic reboot of your favorite childhood show (but hopefully better written!), things might be a little different this time around. There will be glitches, there will be bugs, but hey, that's the beauty of live transmission, right?  Hold on to your spacesuits, folks, it's gonna be a bumpy ride!

Stay tuned for further transmissions...
