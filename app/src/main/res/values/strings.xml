	<string name="privacy_policy_text">To be able to decode SSTV encoded images the app needs access to the microphone.
Having access to the microphone is considered to be a sensitive permission and you have the right to know what the app does with that access:
The data recorded from the microphone is only used to fed the SSTV decoder, VU meter and the spectrum analyzer for visualization of its frequency content.
The app uses a very small temporary buffer in volatile memory and constantly overwrites this buffer with new data from the microphone.
The resulting images from the SSTV decoder is the only data that gets stored in persistent storage on your Android device.</string>
